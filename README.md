[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/shashankdeshpande/langchain-chatbot/Home.py)

Langchain is a powerful framework designed to streamline the development of applications using Language Models (LLMs). It provides a comprehensive integration of various components, simplifying the process of assembling them to create robust applications.

## Sample chatbots
Here are a few examples of chatbot implementations using Langchain and Streamlit:
-  **Basic Chatbot**: Engage in interactive conversations with the LLM.
-  **Chatbot with Internet Access**: An internet-enabled chatbot capable of answering user queries about recent events.
-  **Chat with your documents** Empower the chatbot with the ability to access custom documents, enabling it to provide answers to user queries based on the referenced information.
